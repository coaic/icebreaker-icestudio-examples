# icestudio iCEBreaker examples

This repository contains examples for the amazing [icestudio](https://github.com/fpgawars/icestudio) graphical FPGA design tool. The examples are based on the original Alhambra exmamples provided with the project.

Contributions and fixes are welcome. Also making the examples more suited for the iCEBreaker would be great. If you want to contribute these changes please contact @esden. :)
